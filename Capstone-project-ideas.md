## 1. Movie Recommendation System
GroupLens is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Their [Datasets](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) describe 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided. In this project, we'll build a Movie recommendation system based on collaborative filtering, provide people with the ability to watch movies they like most.

## 2. Sentiment Analysis with Millions of Amazon reviews
Julian McAuley, an assistant professor at UC San Diego, has collected a massive amount of user-generated data from Amazon.com, including 142.8 million reviews (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon) and 1.4 million answered Q&A (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/qa). I this project, we'll do a sentiment analysis with the data set, comparing the rating with the review and category. By analyzing the reviews, we will help users decide which ones to trust as well as report and adjust the fake ratings.
