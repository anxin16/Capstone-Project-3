## 1. Movie Recommendation System
GroupLens is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Their [datasets](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) describe 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided. In this project, we'll build a Movie recommendation system based on collaborative filtering, provide users with the ability to watch movies they like most.
